                        I worked with a group of friends to develop an app called <FONT COLOR = "RED"> Find My Party </FONT>.
                        This is an app which registers local parties nearby and allows users to search for and add their own parties through a 
                        map-view and various table-views. My team and I won second place overall out of approximately 30 teams in the 
                        Cornell University Fall 2021 AppDev Hack Challenge.

                    <h1 text-align: center;> <FONT COLOR = "BLACK"> <font size="+1"> I led a team of four software engineers to develop a command-line based version of the 
                        classic board game Monopoly called <FONT COLOR = "RED"> Cornellopoly </FONT> using OCaml. This project is an online version of the famous game, Monopoly, themed around
                        Cornell locations, landmarks, and inside jokes. The interface shows the user the entire board, their location on the board, and relevant features of the
                        board (prices, property ownership). The user will choose possible actions such as rolling dice, selling properties, and paying tax. The user will
                        be able to move their piece around the board, view property details, and view community chest and chance style cards.
